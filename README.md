The situation in Palestine remains critical, with countless innocent lives affected by ongoing violence and oppression. As global citizens, it's our responsibility to speak up, spread awareness, and support justice and human rights.

Let us pray (make dua) for the people of Palestine and commit ourselves to advocating for peace and dignity for all.

- **ASN Scan**: `-a` ‚Äì Retrieve domains tied to a specific Autonomous System Number.

### üß† Data Source Integrations

- `-c` ‚Äì Pull certificate data from **crt.sh** (by domain).
- `-oc` ‚Äì Pull organization-wide certificate data from **crt.sh**.
- `-i` ‚Äì Query **website.informer.com** for related domain info.
- `-w` ‚Äì Run **reverse WHOIS** lookup for domain ownership links.
